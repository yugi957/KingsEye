### Install Dependencies
- Node.js
- Express & Expo
- install node packages ```npm install```
- Firebase packages: ```npx expo install firebase```

### Important Note:
- server.js depends on npm stockfish library. Due to poor maintanence though, it seems that a file is missing from ```npm install```.
- To remedy this, the file ```stockfish.js``` must be copied into ```node_modules/stockfish/src```

## How to run
- ```npx expo start```
> Might ask to install expo, say yes
- You can scan the qr code on your phone to view development that way, or install an emulator (ios, android), or view on web
> To run from web, install web package: ```npx expo install react-native-web@~0.19.6 react-dom@18.2.0 @expo/webpack-config@^19.0.0```
